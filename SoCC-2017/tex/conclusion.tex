\section{Conclusion}
 In this paper, we present SCache, a shuffle optimization scheme for DAG computing framework. SCache decouples the shuffle from computing pipiline and leverages shuffle data pre-fetch to mitigate I/O overhead of the whole system. By scheduling tasks with application context, SCache bridges the gap among computing stages. Our implementation on Spark and evaluations show that SCache can provide a promising speedup to the DAG framework. We believe that SCache is a simple and efficient plugin system to enhence the performance of most DAG computing frameworks.
