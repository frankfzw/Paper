\subsection{Limitation and Future Work}
SCache aims to mitigate shuffle overhead between DAG computing stages. And the evaluation results show a promising improvement. But we realize some limitations of SCache.

\textbf{Fault tolerence of SCache}: When a failure happened on the SCache master, the whole system will stop working. To prevent the machine failure leading to inconsistency SCache, the master node will log the meta data of shuffle register and pre-scheduling results on the disk. Master can reads logs during recovery. Since we remove the shuffle transfer from the critical path of DAG computing, the disk log will not introduce extra overhead to the DAG frameworks. Note that the master can be implemented with Apache ZooKeeper \cite{zookeeper} to provide constantly service. If a failure happens on a worker, the optimization of tasks on that node will fail. It also violates of all-or-nothing constraint. A promising way to solve the failure on worker is to select some backup nodes to store repcliations of shuffle data during pre-scheduling to prevent the worker failure. We believe combing the high speed of network and memory is a better choice for fault tolerance. As for now, fault tolerance is not a crucial goal of SCache,  we leave it to the future work.  

\textbf{Scheduling with different frameworks}: A cluster for data parallel computing always contains more than one frameworks. Setting priority among jobs submitted from different framework is challenging and complex. However, combining the resource management facilities in data center such as Mesos \cite{mesos} may be a good direction.
