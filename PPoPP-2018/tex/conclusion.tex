\section{Conclusion}
 In this paper, we present SCache, a cross-framework open source shuffle optimization system for DAG computing frameworks. SCache decouples the shuffle from computing pipeline and leverages shuffle data pre-fetching to mitigate the I/O overhead of the whole system. By scheduling tasks with application context, SCache bridges the gap among computing stages. Our implementation with Spark and evaluations show that SCache can provide a promising speedup to the DAG framework. We believe that SCache is a simple and efficient system to enhance the performance of most DAG computing frameworks.
