\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present SCache, a cross-framework shuffle optimization for DAG computing frameworks. 
SCache decouples the shuffle from computing tasks and leverages memory to store shuffle data. 
By tasks pre-scheduling and shuffle data pre-fetching with application context, SCache significantly mitigates the shuffle overhead. 
Our evaluations on Spark with SCache show that SCache can provide a promising speedup. 
With the shared defects of shuffle among different frameworks, we believe that the optimization of SCache is general and easy to adapt.
